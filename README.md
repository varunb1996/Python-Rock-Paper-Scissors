We are going to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in which we would be playing against the computer and we would be able to maintain the scores as well as we are going to add the ability to play again and again.

We will be using Python and its libraries. The first library that we will be using is Tkinter which is a widely used GUI library offered by python, we do not have to install it separately, as it comes with python itself.

Next, we will be using the random library to generate random numbers in order to determine the computerâ€™s choice.
